# README

This repository contains Python code for various algorithms and functions related to lists and sorting. Below is a brief overview of the implemented functionalities and the sources that inspired them.

## 1. Convert Nested List to Flat List

### Functionality:
The code includes a function named `squashNested` that flattens a nested list into a single-level list.

### Usage:
```python
result = squashNested(nested_list)
```

### Reference:
The implementation is inspired by the [GeeksforGeeks article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-convert-a-nested-list-into-a-flat-list/).

---

## 2. Sum Nested List

### Functionality:
The code features a function called `sumNested` that calculates the sum of all numeric elements in a nested list.

### Usage:
```python
total_sum = sumNested(nested_list)
```

### Reference:
The logic draws inspiration from discussions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46669088/sum-of-nested-list-in-python).

---

## 3. Generate Power Set

### Functionality:
The repository includes a function named `powerSet` that generates the power set of a given set.

### Usage:
```python
result_set = powerSet(input_set)
```

### Reference:
The algorithm is influenced by discussions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59868562/how-to-generate-a-power-set-of-a-given-set).

---

## 4. Insertion Sort

### Functionality:
The code contains an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm using a customizable comparator function.

### Usage:
```python
sorted_sequence = insertionSort(sequence, comparator_function)
```

### Reference:
The implementation follows the guidance provided in the [GeeksforGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/).
